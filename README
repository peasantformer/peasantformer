To build native version of Peasantformer - just run

$ make

It will run cmake internally, so don't worry about dependencies - cmake
will check them.
Or, alternativly, you can cd to build-native and run cmake there by own.

If you want to cross-compile windows version of peasantformer - run

$ make cross-win32
