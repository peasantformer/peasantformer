To build native version of Peasantformer - just run

$ make

It will run cmake internally, so don't worry about dependencies - cmake
will check them.
Or, alternativly, you can cd to build-native and run cmake there by own.

If you want to cross-compile windows version of peasantformer - run

$ make cross-win32

Note, if your cross-compiled version yields something like this:

> err:module:import_dll Library libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll (which is needed by L"Z:\\home\\soft\\mine\\peasantformer\\peasantformer.exe") not found
> err:module:import_dll Library libstdc++-6.dll (which is needed by L"Z:\\home\\soft\\mine\\peasantformer\\peasantformer.exe") not found
> err:module:LdrInitializeThunk Main exe initialization for L"Z:\\home\\soft\\mine\\peasantformer\\peasantformer.exe" failed, status c0000135

, you are experiencing clock skews. It means that you have to run

$ make cross-win32

again.
